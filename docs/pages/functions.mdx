# Functions

To define a Lambda function:

-   create a `functions` folder
-   create another folder with the name of your function
-   create an `index.js` file and a `config.js` file.

```
/functions
    /myBlueFunction
        index.js
        config.js
```

## index.js

Inside index.js, you can write your Lambda function like so:

```js
module.exports.handler = async (event) => {
    return 123
}
```

The only requirement is that you export a handler function. Any additional files or node_modules located inside this folder will also be included in the deployment.

## config.js

Inside config.js, we configure the Lambda function. Here is an example:

```js
module.exports = {
    permissions: [
        {
            Effect: 'Allow',
            Action: 'dynamodb:Query',
            Resource: 'arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123412341234:table/myTable'
        }
    ],
    env: {
        STRIPE_ID: '123412341234'
    },
    trigger: 'anotherapp_paymentStarted',
    dashboard: {
        doc: `This is a description of this lambda function`,
        invocationAlarm: 0,
        invocationGoal: 10,
        errorGoal: 0,
        errorAlarm: 2,
        durationAlarm: 20000,
        durationGoal: 1000
    },
    alarm: {
        threshold: 2,
        snsTopic: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123412341234:ChatOpsTopic'
    }
}
```

-   Permissions allows you to define IAM policies, which determine which AWS resources your Lambda function can perform actions on.
-   Env allows you to set environment variables that your Lambda function can use via `process.env.STRIPE_ID` for example.
-   Trigger allows you to setup which EventBridge event will trigger this function
-   Dashboard allows you to define goals and alarms which will be overlayed on top of your CloudWatch dashboard.
-   Alarm allows you to connect your alarms to an SNS topic. This goes hand in hand with the dashboard configuration. Example: if we say we want to alarm if our Lambda function takes more than 10 seconds to execute, how will we be notified when that alarm has been breached? By assigning an SNS topic to this alarm, we can notify the development team via slack, email, or by executing a Lambda function.

## Setting dynamic values in your config

The previous config example uses hard coded values. In real projects we will likely want to define different values per stage and region. Below is an example of using `keywords` to create dynamic values:

```js
module.exports = {
    permissions: [
        {
            Effect: 'Allow',
            Action: 'dynamodb:Query',
            Resource: '{@output.resourceStack.DB}'
        }
    ],
    env: {
        STRIPE_ID: '{@ssm.stripeid}'
    },
    trigger: 'otherApp{@stage}_paymentStarted',
    dashboard: {
        doc: `This is a description of this lambda function`,
        invocationAlarm: 0,
        invocationGoal: 10,
        errorGoal: 0,
        errorAlarm: 2,
        durationAlarm: 20000,
        durationGoal: 1000
    },
    alarm: {
        threshold: 2,
        snsTopic: 'arn:aws:sns:{@region}:{@accountId}:ChatOpsTopic'
    }
}
```
